# JaffnaU-CS-GPA-Calculator

A web-based GPA calculator tailored for direct-intake Computer Science students at the University of Jaffna. This tool calculates the current GPA based on entered marks and estimates the average grade needed in upcoming courses to reach the target overall GPA of 3.0, which is required for 4th-year eligibility.

## Features

- **Current GPA Calculation:** Enter your marks for completed courses to calculate your weighted GPA.
- **Future Grade Estimation:** Determine the average grade required in remaining courses to achieve a final GPA of at least 3.0.
- **Tailored to Curriculum:** Uses the specific course structure and credit distribution for the Jaffna University Computer Science program.
- **Clean Code Structure:** Separated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for easy maintenance and customization.
